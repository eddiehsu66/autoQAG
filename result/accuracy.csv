0,"The process of log template parsing involves identifying common patterns in log messages and creating a template based on those patterns. For example, in the given logs, a template was created to match the error recovery message which includes block ID, pipeline information, and datanode details. Another template was created for a message regarding maximum task failures per node. By using these templates, other language model assistants can accurately parse and categorize similar log messages.",0.6417910447761194,0.5876777251184834,0.6194029850746269
0,The process involves identifying key components in the log message that are consistent across multiple logs and creating a template that captures these key components. This template can then be used to match incoming log messages for accurate parsing and analysis. This helps in improving the accuracy of log template parsing for other language model assistants.,0.6268656716417911,0.5915492957746479,0.6156716417910447
0,"Based on the given examples, the process of log template parsing involves identifying key elements within a log message, such as specific strings or variable values, and converting them into a standardized template format. This can help increase the accuracy of log parsing by allowing language model assistants to recognize common patterns and structures in log messages, making it easier to extract relevant information for analysis or troubleshooting.",0.6791044776119403,0.6285714285714286,0.6156716417910447

0,"Log parsing involves identifying patterns within log messages and creating templates that can be used to classify and organize future log entries.

1,"Reason for wrongResult: The model incorrectly generated additional irrelevant log entries and did not accurately parse the log content provided.
Reason for wrongResult: The model failed to properly parse and identify the specific class and event being registered in the logContent.
Reason for wrongResult: The model is attempting to parse specific fields and values from the log message without considering the overall context or structure of the log message.
Reason for wrongResult: The model repeated the same log message multiple times and included irrelevant information about starting socket readers.
Reason for wrongResult: WrongResult occurs because the model incorrectly inserted placeholders and repeated sentences throughout the logContent.
Reason for wrongResult: The model mistakenly included irrelevant information from other log messages in the output.
Reason for wrongResult: The model failed to properly parse the log content and instead generated unrelated log messages and file paths.
Reason for wrongResult: The model mistakenly tried to parse specific thread names, job IDs, and task IDs as placeholders instead of recognizing the general log message pattern.
Reason for wrongResult: The model failed to correctly parse the values for memory (8192) and vCores (32) in the logContent, resulting in placeholder characters <*> being displayed.",0.7052238805970149,0.6731707317073171,0.6231343283582089
